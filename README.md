## Part 1: Markdown Practice

The first part of this studio is practice with Markdown. Complete each of the following exercises:

You can preview what your Markdown file will look like when styles are added by using Particle Desktop's Markdown Preview feature. To do so:
1. Go to the `Packages` Menu.
1. Select the `Markdown Preview` submenu.
1. Select `Toggle Preview` (You may also want to make a note of the shortcut keys listed so you can quickly open the preview in the future).

***Q1. The above paragraph and this sentence use markdown in a few ways.  Give a brief description of anything unusual you notice.  Just enter your description on the lines below:***

"#" is header type 1
"##" is header type 2
It seem like all the header is green
"Number. " will became red
"`Something`" is blue
"***Something***" is get bold and emphasize

### Lists

Create a numbered list of five of your favorite foods in-order from favorite to least favorite in the designated area below. Be sure to include at least two things that are made of multiple ingredients.  

For each item that has multiple ingredients, create a sub list of a few (2-5) of the ingredients.  Make one of the sub-lists numbered and the other should use bullet points. (It should look like an outline: The ingredients for item n are indented and immediately below item n, but before item n+1)

1. Cheese Burger
  1. Bread
  2. Meat
  3. Cheese
2. Pizza
  * Cheese
  * Dough
  * Flour
  * Pepperoni
3. Pie
  * Fruit
  * Dough
4. Sushi
  * Rice
  * Fish
5. Steak
  * Beef Meat
  * Mushroom

***Q2. Create your list here:***

### Headings

Headings and sub-headings help separate the content of a document.

***Q3. Add a new third tier heading to this document named "My Heading" here:***

### Code

### "My Heading" here:
# This is First Heading
## This is Second Heading
### This is Third Heading

Markdown is often used to document code.  Consequently, it supports embedding code within documents.

***Q4. Create a code block below and include a Java `for`-loop that prints numbers from 0 to 10. Be sure to indicate that it's Java, which will cause Java keywords to be highlighted (for example, depending on your configuration `for` may be purple in the preview window; `int` may be orange, etc.):***

```java
public class ForLoop {
    public static void main(String args[]){
         for(int i=1; i<=10; i++){
              System.out.println(i);
         }
    }
}
```

## Part 2: What is IoT

This class is about IoT.  [Postscapes](https://www.postscapes.com/internet-of-things-examples/) has a list of examples of IoT.  Pick any three categories (Body, Home City, Industry, etc.) and review any one example of each.

***Q5.  Based on your reviews, create a table of the top four distinguishing features of IoT applications. One column of the table should have a brief name for the feature (1-4 words) and the second column should have an explanation:***


|     Name      |     Features     |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|   Narrative Clip   |       Capture authentic video and photos, effortlessly      |   
|  Alarm     | Wellness tracks activity and wellness indicators, giving caregivers real-time insight into each client’s current conditions as well as potential emergent problems.     |
|Ecobee|Smart thermostats like the Ecobee use remote sensors, real-time weather forecasts, and the actual activity in your home during the day to reduce your monthly energy usage by up to 30%, keeping you more comfortable, and offering to save you money on your utility bills.|
|Wemo Outlet|Save money and conserve energy over time by eliminating standby power, measure and record the power usage of any device, and increase its operating lifespan through more efficient use and scheduling.|



Search for some additional IoT examples at other sites and find two examples that you find interesting.
***Q6.  For each example: 1) provide a link to it, 2) provide a brief summary of it, and 3) explain how it corresponds to distinguishing features you identified above and/or or how you may want to revise your list of distinguishing features.  Use lists/sublists to format your answer to this question (A numbered list of 2 items, each of which as 3 sub-items):***


|     Name      |     Features     |     Fact      |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| ------:|    
| Smart home     |       Everything is connect to internet which can help a person manage their home      |    More than 60,000 people currently search for the term “Smart Home” each month    |
|  Wearables     | Track your activity and help the person life better     |     there are plenty of other wearable innovations to be excited about: like the Sony Smart B Trainer, the Myo gesture control, or LookSee bracelet.     |

1. Smart home
  1. Smart Light bulb
  2. Smart Air Conditioners
  3. Smart Garage
2. Smart Tracker
  1. During Sport
  2. Health Care
  3. Track Your Time


## Part 3: Comparing with Peers

Compare your previous work with other people in the class and try to come to a consensus about what IoT is about.

***Q7. Meet someone new.  Find a class member who you don't already know and introduce yourself.  Compare your work conclusions to the above IoT questions. Again, using a list indicate: 1) Who you worked with, and 2) Any discrepancies or interesting observations that arise from comparing your work:***

***Q8. Meet someone else new.  Find another class member who you don't already know and introduce your self.  Again compare your work as before:***
